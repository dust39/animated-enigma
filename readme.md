# Hello There

My intent for this project is to demonstrate my HTML,CSS, Java Script knowledge, and Git/GitHub knowledge. You will see that my website is developed with a mobile first approach. You will notice that I used media queries to make adjustments based on the size of the user's screen. As of the writing of this Readme, you will be able to observe that I have over 20 Git commits, I will most likely have more by the time this project is finished. I used Javascript in this project to show/hide content areas. You will see that I used CSS flexbox, CSS Grid, and CSS Animation in this project.



## My Site 
You dont need anything special to view my site. Is is hosted right here on Github. Just use the following link [ClickHere](https://dust39.github.io/animated-enigma/).  You will also notice that my navigation pane and my footer pane stay fixed while scrolling. Please let me know what you think, all of my contact info can be found on my GitHub Profile page, [ClickHere](https://github.com/dust39).

### My Project Features
#### Media Queries
I have several instances of media queries based on small, medium, and large screen sizes.
1. The site is built mobile first so my main CSS sheet is titled small.css. Any screen resolution below 768 pixels wide will show the site as a single column layout, with a hamburger button for navigation.
2. The 2nd media query looks at the screen resolution for medium size screens or 768 pixels wide up to 1023 pixels wide. The main feature you will notice is that the navigation text gets larger and the navigation links have equal spacing across the viewport.
3. The 3rd media query looks at the screenr resolution for large size screens or 1024 or bigger. The main feature you will notice is that the navigation text gets smaller and the navigation links push over to the left.

#### Javascript
I have a simple Javascript feature with a button toggle function, aptly named "buttonToggle". When in mobile mode, this script expands my hamburger button to show the content of my navigation links. When clicked again, the hamburger button collapses and hides my navigation.

#### CSS Animation
This is a work in progress.

#### Git / GitHub
I also learned and utilized Git a great deal through this project. I learned Git terminal command using GitBash. I learned and utilized teriminal commands noted below in the list below. I made commits anytime I made changes and pushed those commits to my GitHub repository. Check it out my commit history on this project [Here](https://github.com/dust39/animated-enigma/commits/main).
- Git init : to initialize my lcoal repository.
- Git status: to check the status of any file changes in my local repository.
- Git add: to add my changed files to a staging area.
- Git commit: to commit my changed files.
- Git push: to push my local commits up to my GitHub respository.

#### Conclusion
Is there ever a conclusion in technology??? I learned so much working on this project. It may seem simple on the surface, but the amount the I have learned is incredible. I loved the challenge and I look forward to continuing my coding adventure. Thank you to Code Kentucky for this opportunity and Thank You for looking at my project!
